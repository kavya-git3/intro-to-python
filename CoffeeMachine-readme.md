Coffee Machine Project

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Project! This Python program simulates a coffee machine where users can select from a menu of coffee options, check available resources, and make payments to receive their chosen coffee.


We have used the below functions in the project.

check_resources(order_ingredients): This function checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) available to make the selected coffee. 

process_coins(): This function handles the payment process. It asks the user to input the number of 5rs, 10rs, and 20rs coins they want to use for payment. It calculates the total payment amount based on the number of coins and returns the total.

is_payment_successful(money_received, coffee_cost): This function checks if the payment received from the user is sufficient to cover the cost of the selected coffee. 

make_coffee(coffee_name, coffee_ingredients): This function prepares the selected coffee by deducting the required ingredients from the available resources.

display_menu_and_date(): This function displays the current date and the coffee menu to the user.
